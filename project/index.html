        <h2>About Me</h2>

Hello! My name is Amine Elhanchaoui, and I am a beginner digital developer with a strong interest in back-end development.
I am currently learning and improving my skills in Python, C++, PHP, HTML, and CSS to build efficient and scalable web applications.
In addition to coding, I have a great passion for sports, especially football and calisthenics, as well as swimming and running.
I enjoy challenging myself and continuously learning new things in both technology and sports.
As a disciplined and committed individual, I value keeping promises and always strive to improve my skills.
My goal is to grow as a developer and contribute to meaningful digital solutions.
